# DebugPython
Debug snippet for Pyton scripts

I seperated out examples of what I use for 
Debugging code that can be inserted into any python code.
Can be enabled and disabled with a single variable at the begining of the script.
Debugging screen color codes are included; this is just a section that I put in all my scripts so I have the colors available without having to recreate it everytime.

This is not meant to be stand alone, the code is meant to be used inside of any other code.
I specifically use this code on my home projects for use on headless units (ie no monitors).  I utilize SSH to display debug info.
See other projects of mine for examples of use.

I utilize MQTT for some debuging and periodic monitoring but I find the debugging to screen much faster and reliable for finding problems or testing ideas.
